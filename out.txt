using this list to test:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
The total number of ints to sum is 16
The total depth of the tree is 4.0
working on int pair at indexes (0, 1) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 0 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (2, 3) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 2 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (4, 5) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 4 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (6, 7) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 6 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (8, 9) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 8 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (10, 11) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 10 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (12, 13) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 12 to value 2
working on int pair at indexes (14, 15) with values (1, 1)
updated shared memory at position 14 to value 2
done with depth 4.0 proceeding with depth 3.0
now incrementing indexes by 2
working on int pair at indexes (0, 2) with values (2, 2)
updated shared memory at position 0 to value 4
working on int pair at indexes (4, 6) with values (2, 2)
updated shared memory at position 4 to value 4
working on int pair at indexes (8, 10) with values (2, 2)
updated shared memory at position 8 to value 4
working on int pair at indexes (12, 14) with values (2, 2)
updated shared memory at position 12 to value 4
done with depth 3.0 proceeding with depth 2.0
now incrementing indexes by 4
working on int pair at indexes (0, 4) with values (4, 4)
updated shared memory at position 0 to value 8
working on int pair at indexes (8, 12) with values (4, 4)
updated shared memory at position 8 to value 8
done with depth 2.0 proceeding with depth 1.0
now incrementing indexes by 8
working on int pair at indexes (0, 8) with values (8, 8)
updated shared memory at position 0 to value 16
done with depth 1.0 proceeding with depth 0.0
now incrementing indexes by 16
reached the end, result is 16
